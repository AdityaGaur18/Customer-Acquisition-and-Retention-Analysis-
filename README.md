# Customer-Acquisition-and-Retention-Analysis-


## Overview
This project analyzes customer retention patterns using **cohort analysis** on the *Online Retail* dataset. The dataset contains transactional data from an online store, and the analysis identifies how well the business retains customers over time.  

The Jupyter Notebook (`Cohort Retention Analysis.ipynb`) provides a step-by-step implementation of cohort retention analysis, including data preprocessing, cohort grouping, retention matrix calculation, and visualization.
